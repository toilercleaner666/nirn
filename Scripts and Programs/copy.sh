# 	This is an old script that is redundant
# 	It was used to generate the base history files for every province
# 	Sol_InvictusXLII is looking into creating a python file to do that in a more effective manner
#	The goal is to use an input csv and extract information out of that into the files that are being generated.
# 	If for whatever reason you need to use this file, contact Sol on discord

#Create Files
#for i in {1..4272}
#do
#	cat ${i}-${i}.txt
#	cat TEMPLATE.txt > ${i}-${i}.txt
#done

#Dont remember what this does
#for i in {1..4272}
#do
#	sed -i "s/ - /${i}-${i}/" ${i}-${i}.txt
#done
