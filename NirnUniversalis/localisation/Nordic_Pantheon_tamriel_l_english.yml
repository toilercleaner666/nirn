#Flavor Events
nord_religion_flavor.1.t:0 "Flavor 1"
nord_religion_flavor.1.d:0 "The Church is a large landowner and this has brought a great deal of wealth to the Church. The non-possessors claim that the Church is being corrupted by this great wealth. Their opponents argue that the Church needs this wealth to carry out its holy mission. The key thing is the Church isn't really a big taxpayer, if it was forced to give its land away it would move it into the hands of people we can tax. The downside would be the Church would have less wealth to perform its mission."
