desc_eastskyrim_empire:0 "High King Svartr has proven himself a true son of Skyrim and united the lands his father once conquered. For 40 years he has ruled Haafingar, Hjaalmarch and Whiterun with an iron fist, putting down any rebellion while patronizing the arts and trades within the entire realm. All Jarls have been granted their governorships by him and he is the undisputed leader of the Timurid dynasty.\n\nAt the end of his life, however, Shah Rukhs health is frail and his reach limited. Only time will tell if anyone can take on the role as the one ruler of all Timurid provinces after he is gone."
