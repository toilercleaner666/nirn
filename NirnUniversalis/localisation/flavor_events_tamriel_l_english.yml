#Haafingar/Windhelm death of High King/Queen
flavor_SOL.0.t:0 "A Gathering Storm..."
flavor_SOL.0.d:0 "The aging High King of  Western Skyrim, Svartr of Solitude, faces one final challenge in his Golden Years.\n\nWhile his reign has been marked by multiple invasions he has proved an excellent diplomat. Keeping his fledging Empire from falling to pieces and offering a united, if ineffective, front against the Reachmen and Orsimer invaders. However the question of succession has begun to grow more heated. Svargrim, his heir apparent, is not as popular amongst the Jarls as he. A fact that Svartr has been made keenly aware of. Already reports have reached his ears that his Jarls have begun quietly preparing for a war of succession. \n\nUnless Svartr finds a way to centralize his kingdom soon, it's very unlikely that his descendants will rule anything more than a farm."

flavor_SOL.1.d:0 "Svartr of Solitude, the true High King of Skyrim has departed to Sovengarde. Despite his military failings he was as an excellent diplomat and negotiator. His honeyed words having earned him the nickname the 'Silver Tongue of Solitude.' \n\nHis passing has proved disasterous for the realm. Already word has reached Haafingar that the Jarls so loyal to Svartr have begun to speak openly of independence and rebellion. Only time will tell if $MONARCH$ can tame them and restabilize the realm."
