string_start_haafingar:0 "The Kingdom of §YSkyrim§! is no more.\n\n After the death of §YHigh King Logrolf§! a moot was called to elect the new Monarch. Logrolf’s crown was expected to pass to his only child. A daughter named §YFreydis§!. Unfortunately, succession is rarely so simple amongst the Nords. During the moot §YSvartr, Jarl of Solitude§! presented evidence that Freydis was an illegitimate daughter of Logrolf. Those Jarls already unsure of Freydis’ qualities jumped at the opportunity to vote for someone else. That someone being Jarl Svartr. By contrast the Jarls most loyal to Logrolf decried this “evidence” as slander. Angrily they doubled down on their support for Freydis. The moot ended in a tie. 4-4. Neither side willing to budge and both sides claiming victory.\n\n Svartr was crowned High King in §YSolitude§! and Freydis was crowned High Queen in §YWindhelm§!. §YHjaalmarch§!, §YWhiterun§!, and §YFalkreth§! swore fealty to Svartr. While the holds of §YWinterhold§!, §Ythe Pale§!, and §Ythe Rift§! bowed to Freydis. The sundering of the old kingdom of §YSkyrim§! was complete.\n\nNow almost 40 years later the Fatherland lies bleeding. In the West, High King Svartr fights a losing battle against §YReachmen§! and §YOrsimer§! invaders. In the East High Queen Freydis struggles to keep her realm united and centralized. Ironically the two rivals, now facing old age, have come to realize the same thing. After their deaths both East and West Skyrim, are primed to divide even further.\n\nOnly time will tell if Ysgramor’s Kingdom will once again be reunited."
